# User Management System â€“ Refactored

This is a refactored version of a basic user management API using Flask and SQLite.

The project includes endpoints to:
- Create a user
- Get all users
- Get a user by ID
- Update a user
- Delete a user
- Search users by name
- Login using email and password

All passwords are now securely hashed. The code has been cleaned up, modularized, and made secure by preventing SQL injection and validating inputs.
